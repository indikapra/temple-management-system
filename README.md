Introduction
Sri Lanka has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and practice since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century BCE producing eminent scholars such as Buddhaghosa and preserving the vast Pāli Canon. Throughout most of its history, Sri Lankan kings have played a major role in the maintenance and revival of the Buddhist institutions of the island. During the 19th century, a modern Buddhist revival took place on the island which promoted Buddhist education. D In 2007, there were around 6,000 Buddhist monasteries on Sri Lanka with approximately 30,000 monks.

A Buddhist temple or Buddhist monastery, is the place of worship for Buddhists, the followers of Buddhism. They include the structures called vihara, chaitya, stupa, wat and pagoda in different regions and languages. Temples in Buddhism represent the pure land or pure environment of a Buddha. Traditional Buddhist temples are designed to inspire inner and outer peace.

Majority of the temples and monestery manage thier internal data, documentation and other valuable materials such as monk certificates, bibliography and preeches in a phycicall storage. Also, large number of people around the country offer varies nessacities (food and other stuff) in a regulary interval. Most of the famouse temple, it is very difficult to offer dhane (food) to the monks as it has been allocated to the poeople who wish to offer dhane in 365 days of the year. 

Proposed solution is aim to provide the below features to manage intenal information to the monks. 
1. Manage the monks' information including bio data, cerficate, home address, perants detials and contact numbers
2. Manage the dhane and other regualar offering
3. Manage the sunday schools
4. manage the entire stage of the monkhood
5. Notify local approved vaccine schedule for small monks (saamanera)
